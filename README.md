# Working out how to set up a devpod for developing containerized applications

+ gives me the ability to develop an application that can run anywhere, from anywhere
+ the envisioned workflow is to:
  1. Download the devcontainer workspace, which includes source code and dependencies, from github.
  2. Install my dotfiles and start developing. (would be nicer if automated)
  3. Running the app from a container and in compositions while I develop to validate (the app runs in a cluster).
  4. push changes of both deps and code to github.
